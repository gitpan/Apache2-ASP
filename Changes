Revision history for Perl extension Apache2::ASP.

1.19 2007-10-20
  - Minor updates in preparation for the release of Apache2::ASP::WebApp.

1.18 2007-10-20
  - Added before_run() and after_run() methods to Apache2::ASP::Handler.
    These methods can be overridden by subclasses and executed before and
    after the "run()" method is called.

1.17 2007-10-20
  - Updates for Apache2::ASP::Test::UserAgent.
  - Updates for Apache2::ASP::Test::MockRequest.

1.16 2007-10-20
  - Adjusted Apache2::ASP::Config and Apache2::ASP::GlobalConfig to properly support
    support running multiple websites under one Apache instance.
  - Removed "sticky forms" support.

1.15 2007-07-03
  - Added several new pages to the Manual.
  - /handlers/My_Handler and /handlers/My/Handler both map to My::Handler
    for the package and /handlers/My/Handler.pm for the filename.
  - Updated documentation in several places.
  - Local GlobalASA.pm class is now required to use web_application.application_name + '::GlobalASA'
    as its package name.  So if web_application.application_name = "DefaultApp" then
    it would say:
    package DefaultApp::GlobalASA;
    use base 'Apache2::ASP::GlobalASA';
    ...
  - Multiple Apache2::ASP web applications can now be run on the same machine.
  - Successfully installed on Windows, but it requires some work.  And performance is bad.

1.14 2007-06-30
  - $Form data is only forwarded if a page is posting back to itself 
    (i.e. - paging through a recordset) or if the form was posted to
    a FormHandler class.

1.13 2007-06-30
  - Apache2::ASP::Config is subclassable.
  - Added <settings> element in config XML file.
  - Added $Config->settings->(lib|dsn|username|password) to $Config object.
  - $Config->settings->lib is added to @INC automatically.

1.12 2007-06-29
  - Stabilized off-line web application testing API.

1.11 2007-06-29

1.08 2007-06-28
  - Fixed bug "Upload hook failed: Can't call method "isa" on an undefined value at ..."
  - Fixed bug that resulted in multiple cookies being created on the initial request,
    when the first ASP script to be rendered contained Include() or TrapInclude() calls.
  - Added HTML::FillInForm as a dependency.
  - Added built-in "sticky forms" for all ASP scripts, exclusive of UploadHandler subclasses.
  - Began new offline test framework.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::Test::UserAgent.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::Test::MockRequest.

  - Added dependencies HTTP::Request::AsCGI, HTML::FillInForm and CGI::Simple.

1.07 2007-06-23
  - Fixed a bug that caused 404 errors to return a blank page instead of the standard
    '404 Not Found' message.
  - Adjusted POD so that Apache2::ASP::Manual::Intro shows up correctly.

1.06 2007-06-23
  - Fixed a bug in Apache2::ASP::PageHandler that caused a bug in which changed ASP
    scripts would not be reloaded by other Apache processes after the first Apache
    process had recompiled the *.pm file as a result of the ASP script being changed.

1.05 2007-06-23
  - $Application->save() is now called at the end of each (non-error) request.

1.04 2007-06-23

    isa Apache2::ASP::PageHandler.

1.03 2007-06-23

    script should be recompiled or not.

1.02 2007-06-23

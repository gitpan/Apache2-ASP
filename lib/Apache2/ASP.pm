=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apache2::ASP scales out well and has brought the ASP programming model to Perl 
in a new way.

This rewrite had a few major goals:

=over 4

=item * Master Pages

Like ASP.Net has, including nested Master Pages.

=item * Partial-page caching

Like ASP.Net has.

=item * Better configuration

The original config format was unsatisfactory.

=item * Handle multiple VirtualHosts better.

Configuration was the root of this problem.

B<NOTE>: If you use an ORM, make sure your ORM doesn't have any "global" configuration
object in memory, unless it is schema-aware.  L<DBIx::Class> is good and L<Class::DBI::Lite>
also works well with Apache2::ASP.  Do not use L<Class::DBI> with Apache2::ASP
because of configuration overlap problems which arise when you have 2 tables with
the same name in 2 different databases.

=item * Better performance

Server resources were being wasted on unnecessary activities like storing
session state even when it had not changed, etc.

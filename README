NAME
    Apache2::ASP - ASP for Perl, reloaded.

WARNING - ALPHA SOFTWARE!
    This software is still considered Alpha (or Pre-Beta) and should *NOT*
    yet be used for anything except for testing.

SYNOPSIS
      1: use Apache2::ASP;
      2: ???
      3: Profit!!

DESCRIPTION
    Apache2::ASP scales out well and has brought the ASP programming model
    to Perl in a new way.

    This rewrite had a few major goals:

    *   Master Pages

        Like ASP.Net has, including nested Master Pages.

    *   Partial-page caching

        Like ASP.Net has.

    *   Better configuration

        The original config format was unsatisfactory.

    *   Handle multiple VirtualHosts better.

        Configuration was the root of this problem.

    *   Better performance

        Server resources were being wasted on unnecessary activities like
        storing session state even when it had not changed, etc.
